# My Thought Process for the Library Exercise
Hi! Iâ€™m Lucas, and this is my thought process presentation for the library exercise. My approach was to tackle the project requirements in three distinct phases: first, I built the backend, then the frontend, and finally, I addressed the GenAI component.

## Backend
I began by designing the backend's models and selecting the technology stack. I chose **Ruby on Rails** and leveraged its `api-only` mode to capitalize on its speed for rapid application development.

For authentication, I implemented a custom solution to issue and validate a `Bearer Token`. This was a deliberate choice because, while Rails 8's built-in authentication is session-based, a Bearer Token approach is better suited for a stateless, decoupled API interacting with a separate frontend.

I used PostgreSQL as the database. This was an interesting return to relational databases after several years of working primarily with MongoDB, and it provided a valuable refresher on migrations and schema-based design principles.

When implementing the logic, I separated the work into four main areas to ensure a clear and organized structure:
1. Session logic
2. Books logic
3. Borrowings logic
4. Dashboards logic

My approach was to follow a principle of simplicity, relying on Rails's conventions and built-in features to keep the implementation clean and maintainable. I also created fixtures to provide test data for the database and for testing purposes.

## Frontend
For the frontend, I followed the same logical points as the backend to maintain a consistent flow and validate everything as I went. I chose React with TypeScript as it is the tool I am most familiar with. By using TypeScript, I was able to build a more robust and predictable application, catching potential errors early in the development cycle.

To speed up development and ensure a consistent user experience, I adopted Ant Design as the primary design system and a Catppuccin color palette. This allowed me to rapidly build components without needing to create every UI element from scratch.

I adopted a mobile-first development strategy, building and testing features in Chrome's mobile view to ensure optimal performance and layout on smaller screens before adapting the design for desktop displays.

## GenAI
To scaffold the required API, I used a markdown prompt with a Copilot agent. I began by clearly defining the core requirements, including the RESTful API structure, models, associations, and authentication, which helped the agent generate a highly accurate starting point.

Initially, I considered using a tool like Bruno for API testing. However, I decided that including plain curl requests directly in the README.md would provide a zero-dependency solution, making it easier for anyone to test the API endpoints immediately without needing to install additional software.
